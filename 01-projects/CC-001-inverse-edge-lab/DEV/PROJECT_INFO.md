### Authentication System Details
- **Admin Login**: Full access to app + admin panel for managing tokens
- **Token Login**: Users can access with tokens generated by admin
- **Token Features**: 
  - Optional expiration dates
  - Usage limits
  - Revocation capability
  - User profile creation on first use
- **Redis Storage**: All auth data stored in Redis (local or Upstash)

### Git Branches
- `main`: Last stable version without auth system
- `backup-before-auth-system`: Backup of main before auth implementation
- `development`: Current work with token-based authentication

### New Files Added
- `auth_manager.py`: Core authentication logic and token management
- `admin_panel.py`: Streamlit-based admin interface for token management

## Key Algorithms

### Inverse Trading Logic
When betting AGAINST a trader:
- Their run-up → Our drawdown (adverse movement)
- Their drawdown → Our run-up (favorable movement)

Based on D/R flag:
- **RP (Run-up first)**: Trader profits first → We face loss first
- **DD (Drawdown first)**: Trader loses first → We profit first

### Statistical Tests
1. **T-Test**: Tests if mean P/L ≠ 0
2. **Bootstrap CI**: 1000 resamples for robust confidence intervals
3. **Jarque-Bera**: Tests for normal distribution

## How to Resume Work in Future Claude Code Sessions

### Method 1: Direct GitHub Clone (Recommended)
```bash
# In a new Claude Code session:
git clone https://github.com/l4z0rph4z0r/inverse-edge-lab.git
cd inverse-edge-lab
claude code .
```

### Method 2: From Your Local Directory
```bash
# Navigate to where the project is saved
cd /mnt/c/Claude_Code/inverse-edge-lab
claude code .
```

### Method 3: Reference This Session
When starting a new Claude Code session, you can say:
"I have a project called 'Inverse Edge Lab' in my GitHub at https://github.com/l4z0rph4z0r/inverse-edge-lab. Please clone it and continue working on it."

## Important Context for Future Sessions

### What to Tell Claude Code:
1. "This is a Streamlit trading analysis app with multilingual support"
2. "It uses Docker for containerization and Redis for auth"
3. "The Perplexity AI key is already in the code"
4. "Default login is admin/admin123"

### Current Status:
- ✅ Core functionality complete
- ✅ Multilingual support (EN/IT)
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Statistical analysis with significance tests
- ✅ AI assistant integration

### Potential Future Enhancements:
1. Move API keys to environment variables
2. Add user registration system
3. Implement real Redis authentication
4. Add more languages
5. Enhanced visualizations (candlestick charts, heatmaps)
6. Export reports as PDF
7. Batch processing for multiple files
8. Historical analysis tracking
9. Performance optimizations for large datasets
10. Additional statistical tests (Monte Carlo, Walk-forward analysis)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Docker Build Cache
If changes aren't reflected:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### File Upload Errors
Check column mapping in `load_data()` function. The app expects:
- P/L (points) or P/L (P)
- Drawdown (points) or DD (P)
- Run-up (points) or RP (P)
- D/R flag

### Language Not Switching
Clear browser cache or use incognito mode.

### Potential Future Enhancements:

7. Batch processing for multiple files
8. Historical analysis tracking
9. Performance optimizations for large datasets
10. Additional statistical tests (Monte Carlo, Walk-forward analysis)
11. ~~Add commission calculations~~ ✅ DONE
12. Add support for different contract types (futures, forex)
13. Implement position sizing calculations
14. Add risk management metrics (VaR, CVaR)

## Recent Updates (2025-06-16)

### Commission Feature Implementation
- **Problem Identified**: Commission calculations were mixing units (dollars vs points)
- **Solution**: Proper conversion using point value ($2 for MNQ, $5 for MES, etc.)
- **New Features**:
  - Contract size input
  - Commission per side input
  - Point value configuration
  - Display both points and dollars
  - Commission impact analysis section
  - Updated Mathematical Framework with commission explanations

### Repository Cleanup
- Removed Claude Code workflow files that were accidentally included
- Updated .gitignore to be project-specific
- Added comprehensive README with hosting instructions
- Made repository focused solely on Inverse Edge Lab

### Key Learnings for Future Development
1. **Unit Consistency**: Always track whether values are in points or dollars
2. **Commission Impact**: Small edges can be eliminated by commissions - must account for this
3. **Docker Performance**: Use `docker system prune -f` to clean cache when slow
4. **Repository Hygiene**: Keep project files separate from development environment files

## Important for Resuming Work

### Current Docker Setup
```bash
cd 01-projects/CC-001-inverse-edge-lab/DEV
docker compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:8501
```

### Testing Commission Feature
1. Upload the SL5TP30.xlsx file
2. Set commission to $0 first to see gross P/L
3. Set commission to $1.30 per side ($2.60 round trip)
4. Note the dramatic difference in net P/L
5. Commission in points = Commission in dollars ÷ Point value

### Mathematical Framework Update
The dashboard now shows:
- **Step 1**: Calculate gross P/L from inverse positions (in points)
- **Step 2**: Convert commission to points and subtract to get net P/L
- All metrics (Sharpe, MAR, etc.) use net P/L for accuracy

## Last Updated
