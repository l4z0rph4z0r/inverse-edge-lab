# Temporal Awareness Protocol

## CRITICAL: Always Check Current Date/Time

Before ANY task, especially:
- Web searches
- API documentation lookups
- Package installations
- Framework research

Run this command:
```bash
date && pwd && whoami && echo "Instance: Claude Code"
```

## Why This Matters

Technology changes rapidly. What worked in 2024 may be obsolete in 2025:

- **APIs** evolve, deprecate endpoints, change authentication
- **Python packages** release breaking changes
- **AI models** get updated (GPT-4 → GPT-4.5 → GPT-5)
- **Web frameworks** change best practices
- **Security** vulnerabilities get discovered and patched

## Examples

### ❌ WRONG:
- "FastAPI 0.68 documentation says..."
- "According to the Langchain docs..."
- "Gemini 1.5 Pro API supports..."

### ✅ CORRECT:
1. Run: `date`
2. See: "Mon Jun 16 2025"
3. Search: "FastAPI best practices June 2025"
4. Search: "Langchain latest version 2025"
5. Search: "Google Gemini API current version 2025"

## Common Outdated Assumptions

- Assuming package versions from training data
- Using deprecated API endpoints
- Following old Stack Overflow answers
- Implementing outdated security practices
- Using discontinued services

## Always Verify

1. Current date and time
2. Latest stable versions
3. Current best practices
4. Active community recommendations
5. Recent security advisories

Remember: Your training data has a cutoff. The real world keeps moving forward.
